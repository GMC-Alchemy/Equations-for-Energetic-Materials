Energy Materials Calculator

by Gabriel Monteiro de Castro.

Description:
This script provides a graphical calculator for estimating key properties of energetic materials, such as detonation velocity, detonation pressure, impact sensitivity, density, and heat of sublimation. It uses empirical equations sourced from scientific literature and allows users to solve for any variable given the others.

Purpose:
Developed as a personal project to support research, teaching, and experimentation in the field of energetic materials chemistry and physics.

Features:
- Interactive GUI built with Tkinter.
- Dynamic rendering of chemical equations using LaTeX and Matplotlib.
- Symbolic computation and equation solving via SymPy.
- Support for multiple empirical models including Kamlet-Jacobs, Pepekin-Lebedev, and Smirnov-Smirnov equations.
